# Multi-channel Wifi Voltage/Currrent Monitor
 ESP32 based webserver to graph 3 INA260 voltage/current outputs

This GitHub holds the Arduino Ino sketch files for the instructable: https://www.instructables.com/id/Multi-channel-Wifi-Voltage-Current-Meter/

It connects 3 ina260 boards onto an ESP32 board which runs a webserver to present the measured voltage and current levels onto the screen of a computer or mobile.
